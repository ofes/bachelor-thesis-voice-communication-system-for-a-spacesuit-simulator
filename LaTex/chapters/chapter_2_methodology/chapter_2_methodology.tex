\chapter{Methodology}
In the following sections, the basics of electrical energy distribution and telecommunications necessary for this project are discussed. Since the self-sufficient voice communication system is being developed for use in Mars analog regions on Earth, the focus is on developing a model so that the use of the system in said regions can be simulated. The simulation results are then used to verify the designed system and therefore the requirements. At the end of each section it will be discussed how the developed model of the surface bound communication system on Earth has to be adapted, so that it can be used on the Martian surface instead.
