\section{Self-sufficient energy distribution system} \label{sec:energy}
Now the self-suficient energy distribution system of the repeater radio infrastructure is being examined. For this purpose, the PV generators used are first introduced and their behavior for different values of the PV cell temperature $\vartheta_\mathrm{C}$ and the solar irradiance $E_\mathrm{G}$ is examined based on the model mentioned in the subsection \ref{sec:photovoltaic_generators}. The $\mathrm{LiFePO}_4$ battery used is then introduced and the results from the experiments discussed in the subsection \ref{sec:electrochemical} are presented. Finally, the remaining components required for the self-sufficient energy distribution system are introduced and a performance estimation based on a \MATLAB simulation (see appendix \ref{sec:matlab_code}) is carried out in order to assess whether it can supply the repeater radio infrastructure with electrical energy.
