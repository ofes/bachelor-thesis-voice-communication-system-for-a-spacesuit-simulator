# Voice Communication System for a Spacesuit Simulator

This Bachelor’s thesis focuses on designing and evaluating a **voice communication system** with a **self-sufficient energy distribution system** for a spacesuit simulator.

## Key Features
- **Voice Communication System**: Achieves a sufficient fade margin using a **repeater radio infrastructure**.
- **Energy Distribution System**: A **Matlab simulation** estimates daily solar energy yield for different mission locations on Earth, based on:
  - Solar and Earth angular relationships
  - PV generator model
  - LiFePO₄ battery model

## Findings
1. The communication system meets range requirements with a sufficiently large fade margin.
2. The energy distribution system reliably powers the repeater infrastructure in areas with adequate solar radiation.
3. On **Mars**, the Martian ionosphere can reflect electromagnetic waves in the **VHF band** during the day, enabling global communication.
4. Temperature dependencies of electrical devices must be considered for Martian applications.

This project highlights the potential for communication and energy systems on Earth and Mars.
